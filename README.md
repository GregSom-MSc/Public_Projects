# 📓 Public Nano Projects

This is one of my small projects collections. <br>
Take a look, maybe you'll find a nice idea or exercise to copy, learn and replicate.

<p>I will be using Jupyter Notebooks for each Nano Project, unless it generates more files, then I will use folders. The main goal is for you to experiment with each of them, devising your own tools and adapting the code to your specific needs. There will be a growing number of projects that take me more than one session to finish, so be aware that some may me marked as "Draft".</p>

Feel free to copy any file, don't forget to ⭐ the folder if it was valuable 🕶️
