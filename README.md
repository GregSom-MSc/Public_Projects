# 📓 Public_Projects

This is one of my small projects collections. <br>
Take a look, maybe you'll find a nice idea or exercise to copy, learn and replicate.

<p>I will be using Jupyter Notebooks to to each Nano Project. The main goal is for you to experiment with each of them, devising your own tools and adapting the code to your specific needs.</p>

Feel free to copy any file, don't forget to ⭐ the folder if it was valuable 🕶️
