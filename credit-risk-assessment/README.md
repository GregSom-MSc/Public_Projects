**Project CRA: Credit Risk Assessment for Loan Applications**

**Goal:** Deliver a practical application for financial services.

**Description:** I built a a Gradient Boosting ML model to classify loan applications as high-risk or low-risk based on various indicators from scratch. I cleaned, preprocessed the data and developed an initial analysis to provide insights into the information used. Then, I modeled using a benchmark Logistic model and the XGBoost model. I performed an interpretability analysis using SHAP. Finally, I developed a dockerised API with an interactive dashboard.
